Here is 5 GitHub tips for new coders by Alyson La

Tip #1: Change the default text editor
Default text editor when using Git from the terminl is VIM. That will be confusing using VIM if we dont know the specifics VIM commands. The easily way is to change our text editor to Atom, Sublime, or TextMate, and many others.

Tip #2: Change the dotfiles
Dotfiles is genius! We can customize our terminal prompt, so we can see what git branch we are on and also know if we have uncommited changes.

Tip #3: Install Hub
